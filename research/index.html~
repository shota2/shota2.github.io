		<br>
	  		Abstract:  I study the welfare and price implications of consumer privacy.
A consumer discloses information to a multi-product seller, which learns about his preferences, sets prices, and makes  product recommendations. 
While the consumer benefits from accurate product recommendations, the seller may use the information to price discriminate.
I show that the seller prefers to commit to not price discriminate to encourage information disclosure.
However, this commitment hurts the consumer, who could be better off by precommitting to withhold some information.
In contrast to single-product models, total surplus may be lower if the seller is able to price discriminate.

		<li><em><a href="limiting.pdf">Limiting Sender's Information in Bayesian Persuasion</a> </em>(R&R from Games and Economic Behavior) 
		<br>
			This paper studies how the outcome of Bayesian persuasion depends on Sender's information.
	I study a game in which, prior to Sender's information disclosure, Designer can restrict the most informative signal that Sender can generate.
	In the binary action case, I consider arbitrary preferences of Designer and characterize all equilibrium outcomes.
	As a corollary, I derive an information restriction that maximizes Receiver's payoffs: Whenever Designer can increase Receiver's payoffs by restricting Sender's information, the Receiver-optimal way coincides with an equilibrium of the game in which Receiver persuades Sender.

	<li><em><a href="timing.pdf">When to Hold an Auction?</a></em>(with Isaias N. Chaves)
	<br>
 We study the optimal timing of auctions when bidders can arrive and depart stochastically over time.
 First, we show that a revenue-maximizing seller holds auctions too late  or too early, relative to a surplus-maximizing planner, depending on whenever virtual values (censored at 0) are more or less right-skewed than true values.
In particular, revenue-maximizing sellers typically hold auctions inefficiently late.
Second, we prove that, by restricting herself to ex ante optimal deadlines, the seller may waste an arbitrarily large fraction of the revenue from the optimal stopping rule.
Dynamically responding to changes in the bidder pool is therefore essential.
